In this article, we'll explore the latest techniques for structuring large-scale React applications.\n\n## Component Architecture\n\nOne of the most important aspects is **component architecture**. Breaking down your application into small, reusable components is crucial. But it's not just about creating components—it's about creating the right abstraction levels.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n- Keep components focused on a single responsibility\n- Use composition over inheritance\n- Create reusable UI components in a component library\n- Separate business logic from presentation",
